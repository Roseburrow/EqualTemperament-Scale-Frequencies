## What does it do?

This program takes in the number of notes per octave and the starting midi note you want to start from and prints the frequencies of all the notes in that scale assuming equal temperament.

## How to use:

Compile the code and use the command line to give the program input via arguments. Eg:

`nscale notes_per_octave starting_note`

Here is an example with actual input: 

`nscale 12 69`
